              <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
                We live in an era of increased variability and velocity.
                Companies cannot engage anymore in costly long term projects and
                big bang approaches. This new era requires agility, velocity and
                responsiveness that can be achieved incrementally through
                value-based projects targeted at increasing differentiation.
                Companies today, are hindered by complex IT environments,
                characterized by disconnected processes, redundant applications
                and islands of data. The gap between the needs of the business
                users and the ability of IT to support them is growing and
                Companies need to reduce the complexity of their IT
                environments, because that complexity has a direct impact on
                their business performance.

                Does your organization have an enterprise architecture in place?
                Did your ERP vendor ask for it? Most organizations decide they
                need to implement something major (ERP system, CRM, Big Data
                etc), but have no idea how it fits into their organization
                because the enterprise architecture does not exist. Is this what
                you are facing?
              </p>
              <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
                At Ataali, we address these challenges through a shift from ERP
                to Enterprise Architecture where the focus is from
                standardisation (enabled by ERP) to differentiation (enabled by
                EA).
              </p>
              <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Enterprise Architecture consists of a set of open,
                standard-based technologies that enable a company to build
                flexible and configurable business processes, transform data
                into insights, deliver more value to the business users, reduce
                time-to-value and create competitive differentiation, while
                leveraging existing investments.
              </p>
              <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
                We pride ourselves, over so many years of experience that
                Enterprise Architecture cannot be practiced in isolation.
              </p>
              <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
                We combine Enterprise Architecture and Business Process
                Management (BPM), focusing on business optimization in terms of
                effectiveness, efficiency, value drivers and performance drivers
                and/or continuous improvements, which are all disciplines of
                business process management (BPM) that provides the opportunity
                of optimizing the alignment of business with IT in delivering
                real business transformation, thereby running Enterprise
                Architecture programmes from a complete business perspective
                that creates sustainable differentiation.

              <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Enterprise architecture is a blueprint used for acquiring,
                planning, and implementing an ERP / CRM system (like SAP,
                Oracle, SalesForce, MicroSoft), SOA and Cloud Technologies into
                an organization. IT helps you to understand the best method for
                communication (web services or some other methods) and other
                critical areas that already exist within the organization. We
                help clients build high-performing EA organizations by working
                with them to clarify, align and implement their EA functions
                aligned with their strategies. Our team provides expertise in
                the implementation, transformation, organizational design,
                staffing models, people, business & IT strategy alignment.

              <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
                At Ataali, Solution architecture starts with an understanding of
                the problem, which should be documented in the business
                scenario, and this is where so many projects fail.
              </p>
              <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Too many people have the idea that solving a problem is all
                about coding.

              <h3 class="leading-relaxed text-blue-600 mb-8">
                At Ataali Consulting, we understand the difference.

              <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
                The Solution Architect has the responsibility for architectural
                design and documentation  at a system or subsystemlevel, such as
                management or security.
              </p>
              <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
                The focus of the Solution Architect is on system technology
                solutions; for example, a component of a solution such as
                "Enterprise data warehousing;” "Customer Experience" etc.
              </p>
              <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Within TOGAF ADM, Solution Architects mostly operations between
                phases E to G, with a specific focus on Phases E (Opportunities
                and Solutions) and F (Migration Planning).
              </p>

              <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
                The Solution Architect is a member of the Enterprise
                Architecture team but becomes at a later stage also a member of
                the Development team acting as the bridge between concepts and
                implementation.
              </p>
              <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
                However, the Solution Architect does not operate at the
                Strategic Architecture level(at the level of the Enterprise) but
                mostly at Segment and Capability Architecture levels.
              </p>
              <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Solution Architects are the best qualified to identify the
                appropriate Solution Building Blocks (SBBs). They participates
                in the definition of any Transition Architectures, identifies
                potential solutions, and helps to formulate a high-level
                implementation and migration strategy.
              </p>
              <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
                During the Migration Planning phase they also have an important
                mission to ensure that SBBs are properly designed or that
                acquired solutions support business requirements. The Solution
                Architect may work closely with the vendor if a COTS solution is
                considered. A solution includes the hardware, software, and
                supporting people and documentation to solve a problem
              </p>
              <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
                At Ataali, our experienced Solution Architects will work with
                you to identify the gaps in the existing enterprise solutions
                framework (If any) and the specific SBBs required to fill these
                gaps. These SBBs may have a one-to-one or many-to-one
                relationship with the projects. The solutions architects will
                define exactly how this will be done. There may be other
                projects working on these same capabilities and the solutions
                architects will ensure that they can leverage best value from
                these investments.
